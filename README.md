Cylindrical-Duct-Modes: This package contains 3 files.
Bez_first_mnzeros.m -a function that generates a table containing zeros of the Bessel Function of the first kind order m out to n zeros.

Cylindrical_Membrane_Modes.m -plots the mode shape for modes (m,n) entered on lines 12 and 13 of the code.

Cylindrical_Membrane_Animation.m -an animation. The animation is generated by combining the individual modes to form the initial displacement, the modes are then advanced in time each by their own Eigen frequency.
